# OraxenToggle

OraxenToggle is a lightweight plugin designed to provide server administrators with control over the **Oraxen resource pack auto-download feature**. With this plugin, you can easily enable or disable the automatic download of the Oraxen resource pack for players, without needing to restart the server or manually alter configuration files.

## Features

- **Toggle Oraxen Resource Pack Download:** Instantly enable or disable the automatic resource pack prompt for players.
- **Permission-Based Access:** Restrict toggling commands to authorized users.
- **Lightweight & Easy to Use:** Minimal setup required; easy integration with any server running Oraxen.
- **Configurable:** Customize command names, permissions, and plugin messages.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

Before using OraxenToggle, make sure to disable automatic pack dispatch in Oraxen to enhance flexibility and user experience.  
Edit your Oraxen `settings.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
dispatch:
  send_pack: false
  send_on_reload: true
  delay: -1
  mandatory: true
  prompt: "<#fa4943>Accept the pack to enjoy a full <b><gradient:#9055FF:#13E2DA>Oraxen</b><#fa4943> experience"
  join_message:
    enabled: false
    delay: -1
```

> **Note:**  
> Setting `send_pack: false` ensures that OraxenToggle has full control over when the pack is sent.
